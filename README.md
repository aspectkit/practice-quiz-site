## Description

This website is a coding quiz used to test student's knowledge on all things coding. It allows the user to be timed on a quiz and save their score to the highscores page. I learned how javascript can interact with html and css. I learned javascript algorithms. Lastly I learned about local storage to save data over a period of time.

If the user clicks start a series of questions for the user to answer will appear. Once at the end, an end screen will appear. The user can enter their initials for the highscores page. Once the user enters their information a back button will appear to take the quiz again.
